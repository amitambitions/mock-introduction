What is Testing
===============

Testing in general programming terms is the practice of writing code (separate from your actual application code)
that invokes the code it tests to help determine if there are any errors.

It does not prove that the code is correct (which is only possible under very restricted circumstances). It merely
reports if the conditions the tester thought are handled correctly.
